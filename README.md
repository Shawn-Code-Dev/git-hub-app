# Gitbook App
Use it here: [Deployment](https://git-hub-app-mu.vercel.app/)
## Current Features
1. There's dark mode :) Built into ContextAPI for future "Theme Context Switching"
2. Gitbook allows you to search for users, using the official GitHub API
3. After inputting a search, a list of user cards that match your search results will appear
4. Each card has a button that takes you to a more detailed view on the user.
5. If the user list isn't empty, a button will appear, allowing you to clear the users state.
6. Alert context has been built for cases where the search has no input, but the form has been submitted.
7. Login and Registration forms with functioning validation. However, they don't currently do anything else.
## Future Features
Instead of a list, I want to give a general idea of what I'm currently working on with this project. I want Gitbook to allow users to not only search the GitHub API, but also to log in & save users. After saving users, I want the saved user cards to appear on the profile page of whoever is currently logged in. I am currently working on setting up the PostgreSQL database to accommodate this and am excited to complete this project.
