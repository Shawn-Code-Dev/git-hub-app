      <p>
        This is an updated version of my original Gitbook app.
        I've updated it from a simple frontend single page application
        to a full-stack application using industry-standard frontend and backend utilities and libraries.
        I'm updating this app to use React Router v6, StyledComponents among other improvements.
      </p>
